# Streamlit + Firebase Authentication

Simple boilerplate Streamlit app with Authentication using Firebase Web API:

- Everything needed for the most common email and password authentication operations (Sign In, Account Creation, Password Reset, Sign Out, Account Deletion).

- Built-in error handling, loading states (spinners), success and warning messages

- No dependencies (except the `requests` library for the API calls)

- No custom components (only Streamlit-native widgets)

**Note:** Remember to add your Firebase project Web API key to the .streamlit/secrets.toml... **and keep it a secret!**
